# Debug

Debug is a feature that controls the amount of logs produced by the network-manager
snap. It is useful for collecting information required to either report a bug or
investigate a network-manager failure (if happens).

The default is disabled by default and has to be explicitely turned on for
usage.

Note that the debug logs may contain sensitive information

## Enable Debug

The network-manager snap provides a single configuration option which can be used to
turn the debug feature either on or off:

 * **debug.enable**

The option takes a boolean value. The meaning of the possible values are:

 * **true:** Enable logging debug information
 * **false (default):** Disable logging debug information

Changing the **debug.enable** configuration option have immediate
effect as network-manager service restarts just after setting the new value

**Example:** Enable debug feature

```
$ snap set network-manager debug.enable=true
```

<br/>
**Example:** Disable debug feature.

```
$ snap set network-manager debug.enable=false
```

## Viewing logs

The debug information, when enabled, will be available in the journal and can
be viewed with:

```
$ journalctl --no-pager -u snap.network-manager.networkmanager.service
```
