# Available Commands

The NetworkManager upstream project comes with a few commands which can be used
to control and manage the NetworkManager service. This page gives a short overview
of those commands which are available as part of the snap and what they are used for.
Further details about their usage is given on linked pages.

## nmcli

The nmcli command offers a command-line based way to control and manage the
NetworkManager service.

An explanatory description of the command and available options are available
[here](https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/1.2/nmcli.html)

## network-manager.nmtui

nmtui is the Network Manager Text User Interface. It is a curses-based application
that allows easy configuration of connections and networking settings. Besides
network-manager.nmtui, these other three commands are available:

* network-manager.nmtui-edit
* network-manager.nmtui-connect
* network-manager.nmtui-hostname

More details can be found in the [manual page](https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nmtui.html).
