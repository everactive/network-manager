# Configure WiFi Connections

First, determine the name of the WiFi interface:

```
$ network-manager.nmcli d
DEVICE             TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION
...
wlan0              wifi      disconnected     --
```

Make sure the WiFi radio is on (which is its default state):

```
$ network-manager.nmcli r wifi on
```

Then, list the available WiFi networks:

```
$ network-manager.nmcli d wifi list
*  SSID           MODE   CHAN  RATE       SIGNAL  BARS  SECURITY         
   ...
   my_wifi      Infra  5     54 Mbit/s  89      ▂▄▆█  WPA2      
```

As an example, to connect to the access point ‘my_wifi’, you would use the
following commands:

```
$ network-manager.nmcli c add con-name <name> ifname wlan0 type wifi ssid my_wifi
$ network-manager.nmcli c modify <name> wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk wifi-sec.psk <password>
```

<name> is an arbitrary name given to the connection, and <password> is the
password for the connection (this last command can be used to change the
password too). New connections have DHCP enabled for both IPv4 and IPv6 by
default.

Once a connection has been created, NetworkManager will consider it for
a given connection whenever the device’s WiFi is disconnected and NetworkManager
detects the access point is available via recent scan results.

The autoconnect behaviour of a connection can be changed by modifying the
connection’s autoconnect property:

```
$ network-manager.nmcli c modify <name> connection.autoconnect [yes|no]
```

Some other interesting commands follow.

To show the details of a connection:

```
$ network-manager.nmcli c show <name>
```

To trigger a manual WiFi scan:

```
$ network-manager.nmcli d wifi rescan
```

To delete a connection:

```
$ network-manager.nmcli c delete <name>
```
