  * Stage only copyright of staged packages
    Some copyright files were not needed as they come from packages from
    which we do not take any file.
    
    Do not stage libsqlite3
    libsqlite3 is already included in the core snap.
    
    Add unstage.txt file
    This file contains a list of debian package that we are not actually
    staging, although snapcraft adds them to manifest.yaml. CI now
    recognizes this file, and manually removes the listed packages from the
    manifest when releasing a snap to the store.

  * snap: copy changelog to the package
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/network-manager/+merge/372525
  * Do not stage libraries that are part already of the core snap and that
    in fact we were not even including in the snap. This will remove some
    dependencies from the manifest so we will not get CVEs for these libs
    that do not actually affect us.
    
    Use documented way of specifying slots and hooks
    
    Remove calls to set log level in wrapper:
    The calls were actually failing as NM was not started yet. Furthermore,
    the log level is set via a call option in NM. Also remove nmcli-internal
    as after this it is not used anymore and probably there will be no need
    for it in the future (we restart always NM when the settings change
    instead of dynamically changing it).
    
    test: debug-config-option: robustify and fix:
    '!' does not have the expected effect with 'set -e'. Also, wait a bit
    when NM is re-starting. Ideally we should wait for it to appear on DBus
    though.

  * Make sure there is no race condition between the configure hook and the start of the NM daemon. This is fulfilled by making sure that the only script that touches configuration files is the NM wrapper, while the configure hook only checks the snap properties and re-starts NM if a change has been detected (the later is done by comparing with a file that contains the state in the previous call to the hook). Fixes LP: #1748154.

  * Add configuration item to allow users to enable ethernet support
    
    The current implementation requires to reboot the device two times which is not really what we want but not possible to change until we have a network-setup-control interface which would allow our hook to change the netplan configuration directly.

  * Change debug activation to avoid having to re-start NM.
    To be able to re-start NM the core-support plug was being used, which
    would have never been accepted in the Ubuntu store, as that interface
    is meant to be used by the core snap only. Instead, avoid having to
    restart by using nmcli to dynamically activate/deactivate debug option.
    For this we need to use the nmcli plug instead for the configure hook.

  * Debug enable/disable config option.
    
    You can restart network-manager service in debug mode by:
      snap set network-manager debug.enable=true
    
    and disable debug mode:
      snap set network-manager debug.enable=false
    
    Default value is false.
    
    When set to true, service is started with these flags:
      --debug --log-level=DEBUG
    
    NOTE: Additionally, there are some spread tests changes to make them more stable
