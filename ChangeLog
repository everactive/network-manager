    taken from upstream. Related to LP: #1800712.
    
    Empty commit so changelog is updated on release. The real change has
    happened in the network-manager/xenial/1.2.2 code branch.

    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/snappy-hwe-snaps/+git/network-manager/+merge/343839
  * * Fix snapcraft 2.42.1 warnings
    * Add network interface to configure hook, for snapctl
    * Do not stage libc6, as that makes snapcraft to set RPATH in the binaries
    * Reduce size of the snap

  * tests: remove buggy test
    
    This check fails because output of "snap list" changes continuously, so
    you cannot rely on it. Also, the check is redundant.

  [ Alfonso Sanchez-Beato <alfonso.sanchez-beato@canonical.com> ]
  * Make sure there is no race condition between the configure hook and the start of the NM daemon. This is fulfilled by making sure that the only script that touches configuration files is the NM wrapper, while the configure hook only checks the snap properties and re-starts NM if a change has been detected (the later is done by comparing with a file that contains the state in the previous call to the hook). Fixes LP: #1748154.

  * Add configuration item to allow users to enable ethernet support
    
    The current implementation requires to reboot the device two times which is not really what we want but not possible to change until we have a network-setup-control interface which would allow our hook to change the netplan configuration directly.

  * Change debug activation to avoid having to re-start NM.
    To be able to re-start NM the core-support plug was being used, which
    would have never been accepted in the Ubuntu store, as that interface
    is meant to be used by the core snap only. Instead, avoid having to
    restart by using nmcli to dynamically activate/deactivate debug option.
    For this we need to use the nmcli plug instead for the configure hook.

  * Debug enable/disable config option.
    
    You can restart network-manager service in debug mode by:
      snap set network-manager debug.enable=true
    
    and disable debug mode:
      snap set network-manager debug.enable=false
    
    Default value is false.
    
    When set to true, service is started with these flags:
      --debug --log-level=DEBUG
    
    NOTE: Additionally, there are some spread tests changes to make them more stable
